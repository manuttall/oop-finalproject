## Abstract

### Simplistic Object Rendering In Python:

This presentation will showcase the development of a simple rendering engine in Python, utilizing object-oriented design patterns to structure the program efficiently. The software will be designed with modular architecture, enabling users to create and manipulate objects. Custom classes and objects will be built upon existing libraries, and then rendered within the engine. The project will emphasize best practices in software development, such as unit testing and error handling, detailed documentation with UML diagrams via 4+1 Views, and the design of a clear public API for ease of use and extension. Through this demonstration, we will walk through the software engineering process, from planning and design to implementation and testing. Additionally, we will explore and discuss trade-offs in rendering algorithms, and highlight scalability considerations. By the end of the presentation, this software will exhibit a simple rendering engine that adheres to software engineering principles.
